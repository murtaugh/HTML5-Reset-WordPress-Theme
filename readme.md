#  HTML5 Reset Wordpress Theme

## Summary:

The HTML5 Reset Wordpress theme is a blank theme based on the [HTML5 Reset templates](https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset). It's a great empty slate upon which to build your own HTML5-based Wordpress themes.

In addition to all the standard Wordpress elements and classes, we have added the code required so that the single post template conforms with the [hNews microformat](http://microformats.org/wiki/hnews).

### HTML5 Reset brings to the table:

1. A style sheet designed to strip initial files from browsers, meaning you start off with a blank slate.
2. Easy to customize -- remove whatever you don't need, keep what you do.
3. Analytics and jQuery snippets in place
4. Meta tags ready for population
5. Empty mobile and print style sheets, including blocks for device orientation
6. Modernizr.js [http://www.modernizr.com/](http://www.modernizr.com/) enables HTML5 compatibility with IE (and a dozen other great features)
7. IE-specific classes for simple CSS-targeting
8. iPhone/iPad/iTouch icon snippets 
9. Lots of other keen stuff...
